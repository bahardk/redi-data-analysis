#### Exercises for class II.

The `script.sql` loads three tables with data in the database. The data is
generated randomly and represents a basic E-Commerce database:

* `customers` table contains personal data for each customer.
* `products` table contains descriptions for the products on sale.
* `orders` table contains the history of all products that customers bought.

Our target for this class would be to introduce the concept the SQL
JOIN, GROUP BY and ORDER BY concepts. We'd also introduce the aggregation
function `SUM` from SQL.

Once we've done this, we can answer the million dollar question:

* What is the total revenue from the orders our customers created grouped by
  region in Germany.
